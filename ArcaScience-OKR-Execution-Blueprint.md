# PART A — PRESENT

> Use this section for your team kickoff, investor updates, and board presentations.
> Each numbered section maps to one "slide" or talking point.

---

## A1. WHY THIS QUARTER IS DIFFERENT

This is a **leverage quarter**. We have a working platform, differentiated tech, and early traction. Now we prove three things:

| Proof Point | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Repeatable product outcomes** | BRA is 5-10x faster, auditable, regulator-ready — and we can show it |
| **Repeatable therapeutic launches** | We can go deep in a therapeutic area in weeks, not months |
| **Repeatable revenue engine** | We can sell $500k ARR through a disciplined, pack-first motion |

If we prove all three, we become the global standard. If we prove two out of three, we have a strong company. If we prove one, we're a science project.

---

## A2. THE VALUE CHAIN — HOW THE THREE OBJECTIVES CONNECT

```
O1 (Platform)  ──►  O2 (Therapeutic Packs)  ──►  O3 (Revenue)
   ENGINE              ACCELERATOR                OUTCOME
```

| Link | Mechanism | What Breaks if It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| **O1 → O2** | Platform speed + exports enable pack creation | Packs can't be built to definition of done |
| **O2 → O3** | Packs compress sales cycles by 40-60% | We're selling a generic platform — longer cycles, lower win rate, lower ACV |
| **O3 → O1** | Revenue funds next engineering round | Platform roadmap stalls. No on-prem. No enterprise scale |
| **O1 → O3** | Power users become internal champions | Expansion revenue = $0 without adoption |

**Critical path:** "BRA in Minutes" must be demo-ready by **Week 4**. First therapeutic pack must be validated by **Week 7**. These are hard dependencies for O3.

---

## A3. THE THREE OBJECTIVES — AT A GLANCE

### O1 — Make BRA the Reference Way to Do Benefit-Risk

> *Deliver a BRA platform that produces regulator-ready packages 5x faster, with full traceability, at 99.5% uptime — making it impossible for evaluators to prefer the old way.*

| KR | Target | Stretch | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speed — BRA production time reduction | 5x faster | 7x | Charbel |
| Insight Density — actionable insights vs manual | 10x more | 20x | Vassili |
| Compliance — BRAT/CIOMS-ready exports | 100% of flagship runs | + auto uncertainty | Vassili |
| Reliability — uptime + critical bugs | 99.5%, -50% bugs | 99.9% | Jeff |
| Adoption — weekly power users | 15 users | 25 | Charbel |

---

### O2 — Launch 2-3 Therapeutic Areas with Repeatable Packs

> *Deliver 2 complete therapeutic packs (Lung Cancer + Immunology) with validated cases and sales-ready GTM materials. Stretch: 3rd pack (Cardiology/Hyloris).*

| KR | Target | Stretch | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Launch packs (full DoD) | 2 packs | 3 | Vassili |
| Expert-reviewed cases per area | 3/area | 5/area | Vassili |
| Sales enablement bundle per area | 2 bundles | 3 | CEO |
| Qualified opps from pack positioning | 6 opps | 10 | CEO |

**Definition of Done (all four required):**
1. Therapeutic Pack in platform (endpoints, risks, queries)
2. Reference Demo Case (golden-path story)
3. Medical Validation (expert sign-off)
4. Go-to-Market Bundle (one-pager, deck, demo script, pricing, CS playbook)

---

### O3 — Reach $500k ARR Run-Rate

> *Build a repeatable revenue engine through pack-first enterprise subscriptions, disciplined pipeline management, and systematic expansion — proving ArcaScience is a scalable commercial entity.*

| KR | Target | Stretch | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARR run-rate | $500k | $650k | CEO |
| New logos signed | 3 | 5 | CEO |
| Accounts expanded | 2 | 4 | CEO + Product |
| Pipeline coverage (qualified pipe / target) | 3x ($1.5M) | 4x ($2M) | CEO |
| Win rate on qualified opps | 25% | 35% | CEO |
| Average sales cycle | <60 days | <45 days | CEO |

---

## A4. REVENUE MATH — THREE PATHS TO $500K

### Target Scenario

| Source | Deals | ACV | Total ARR |
|---|---|---|---|
| New logos (enterprise) | 1 | $175k | $175k |
| New logos (mid-market) | 2 | $100k | $200k |
| Expansion (existing) | 2 | $40k | $80k |
| Pilot conversion | 1 | $45k | $45k |
| **Total** | **6** | **$83k avg** | **$500k** |

### Conservative ($350k — 70% = success)

| Source | Deals | ACV | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise | 1 | $150k | $150k |
| Mid-market | 1 | $100k | $100k |
| Expansion | 1 | $50k | $50k |
| Pilot | 1 | $50k | $50k |
| **Total** | **4** | | **$350k** |

### Aggressive ($650k — stretch)

| Source | Deals | ACV | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise | 2 | $175k | $350k |
| Mid-market | 2 | $75k | $150k |
| Expansion | 3 | $50k | $150k |
| **Total** | **7** | | **$650k** |

**The Iron Rule:** Weeks 1-6 = pipeline weeks. Weeks 7-12 = closing weeks.

---

## A5. PRICING ARCHITECTURE

| Tier | Name | Includes | Price | For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | BRA Essentials | Platform (5 seats), 1 pack, standard onboarding | $75k-$100k/yr | Mid-market biotech |
| Tier 2 | BRA Professional | Platform (15 seats), 2 packs, guided onboarding, BRAT/CIOMS exports | $125k-$175k/yr | Mid-to-large pharma |
| Tier 3 | BRA Enterprise | Unlimited seats, all packs, dedicated CSM, on-prem, SLA | $200k-$300k/yr | Top-20 pharma |
| Add-on | Therapeutic Pack | Additional area pack | $25k-$40k/yr | Any tier |

**Five pricing rules:**
1. Never sell platform without a pack — "Platform + Pack" is the minimum unit
2. Never do custom work for <$50k — price consulting at $2,500/day
3. Annual contracts only — no monthly, no quarterly
4. Multi-year discount: 10% (2yr), 15% (3yr) — only to accelerate close
5. Pilots: 3 months at 40% of annual, with defined success criteria upfront

---

## A6. 12-WEEK RHYTHM — THE ARC OF THE QUARTER

| Weeks | Phase | Build | Sell | Validate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1-2** | Foundation | CRM, pricing, target list, outbound sequences | 10 outbounds, 5 warm intros, 3 meetings booked | Pack specs locked, demo-ability check |
| **3-4** | Pipeline acceleration | Lung Cancer demo case v1, one-pagers, pilot template | 3-5 discovery calls, 2-3 demos, first proposal | 3x speed demo-able? Pilot criteria tested? |
| **5-6** | Pipeline peak | Pack 1 at 75%, sales deck v2, reference story v1 | Pipeline $1M+, 2-3 proposals out, first negotiation | First expert review, sales pace check |
| **7-8** | Closing mode | Pack 1 validated, Pack 2 at 60%, GTM bundle 1 done | First logo closed, pipeline $1.2M+, expansion proposed | Pack used in live demo, cycle data |
| **9-10** | Acceleration | Pack 2 validated, GTM bundle 2 done | 2nd-3rd logos, first expansion, pipeline $1.5M+ | Repeatable motion? Pack-close correlation? |
| **11-12** | Close sprint | All materials finalized, next-quarter OKR drafted | $500k ARR, next-quarter pipeline $500k+ | Full metrics, sales motion documented |

---

## A7. RISK MATRIX — WHAT COULD KILL THE QUARTER

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insufficient pipeline Weeks 1-6 | High | Fatal | CEO: 30%+ time on revenue. Pipeline <2x = emergency mode |
| Sales cycles >60 days | High | Severe | Pack-first demos. Champion acceleration. Kill >90 day deals |
| Custom work trap | Medium | Severe | "Pack-first rule." Executive triage for any custom request |
| Demo not compelling | Medium | High | Demo-ability gate at Week 4. Ship 80% quality over 100% late |
| Expansion = $0 | Medium | Moderate | Usage instrumentation by Week 2. Account health reviews monthly |
| ACV erosion (<$80k avg) | Medium | Moderate | Pricing discipline. No discounts — offer multi-year or scope instead |
| Deals slip to next quarter | High | Moderate | Focus warm pipeline. Compress procurement. Mid-market backup plan |

**Cut list (in order of priority if spread too thin):**
1. Cut Pack 3 (Cardiology) — stretch, not core
2. Cut O1 stretch goals (99.9% uptime, auto uncertainty)
3. Cut conference attendance (unless 3+ qualified prospects there)
4. Cut internal process improvements mid-quarter
5. **NEVER cut:** Pipeline reviews, demo prep, proposal speed

---

## A8. FAILURE MODES — THE FIVE WAYS WE LOSE

| # | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"Great product, no revenue"** | O1 and O2 succeed, O3 misses. Board loses GTM confidence. Next round doesn't happen |
| 2 | **"Custom project trap"** | Deals devolve into bespoke consulting. Looks like $500k but it's services, not ARR. Margins crater |
| 3 | **"Pipeline desert"** | So focused on closing that nobody builds new pipe. Quarter ends with $300k and an empty funnel |
| 4 | **"Founder bottleneck"** | Every deal needs CEO from call 1 to close. No system. No scale. CEO burns out |
| 5 | **"Expansion amnesia"** | Existing customers ignored. No usage data. Easiest ARR left on the table |

## C3. SALES OPERATING SYSTEM — REFERENCE PLAYBOOKS

### C3.1 Stage Definitions

| Stage | Name | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Max Duration | Close Probability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S0 | Target Identified | Fits target profile. Contact found | First outreach sent | — | 5% |
| S1 | Meeting Booked | Positive response. Call scheduled | Discovery call completed | 1-2 weeks | 10% |
| S2 | Discovery Complete | Pain confirmed. Budget discussed. Process known | Agreed to demo | 1-2 weeks | 20% |
| S3 | Demo Delivered | Pack demo shown. Tech Q&A done | Champion confirmed. Proposal requested | 1-2 weeks | 40% |
| S4 | Proposal Sent | SOW/pricing delivered. Timeline agreed | Verbal yes or negotiation started | 1-3 weeks | 60% |
| S5 | Negotiation | Terms being finalized. Legal/procurement active | Signed contract | 1-4 weeks | 80% |
| S6 | Closed-Won | Contract signed. Payment terms agreed | Onboarding starts | — | 100% |
| SX | Closed-Lost | Dead. Reason documented | Post-mortem done | — | 0% |

### C3.2 Qualification Criteria (MEDDPIC for BRA)

**A deal is "qualified" (S2+) only when ALL confirmed:**

| Letter | Criteria | Must-Have Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **M** | Metrics — cost of current BRA process | Can quantify: "$X per assessment" or "Y months per report" |
| **E** | Economic Buyer — who signs | Named individual, VP+ level |
| **D** | Decision Criteria — what they evaluate | Speed, auditability, compliance (at least 2 of 3) |
| **D** | Decision Process — procurement steps | Steps + timeline documented |
| **P** | Pain — what's broken | Specific: failed audit / behind schedule / lost submission |
| **I** | Identify Champion — internal advocate | Named person who will fight for us |
| **C** | Competition — who else they evaluate | Known: no one, consultants, or named competitor |

### C3.3 Disqualification Triggers — Kill the Deal If:

1. No budget confirmed AND no budget cycle within 60 days
2. No identifiable pain — they're "exploring" without urgency
3. Decision maker 3+ levels removed from contact
4. Therapeutic area outside our launched packs (unless >$200k enterprise)
5. Want free pilot with no defined success criteria
6. Procurement timeline >90 days
7. Want custom work that doesn't map to a pack
8. Gone silent >14 days despite 3 follow-up attempts

### C3.4 Red Flag Playbook

| Red Flag | How to Detect | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Ghost champion** | No response in 7 days | Multi-thread: contact a 2nd person. If no response in 14 days → disqualify |
| **Happy ears** | "Sounds great!" but no next step scheduled | Force it: "Can we schedule the next step right now?" |
| **Infinite pilot** | Pilot >30 days, no evaluation criteria met | Set 48-hour deadline for evaluation call. Kill if no engagement |
| **Procurement black hole** | In legal with no named contact or timeline | Get named procurement contact + expected date. No name = not real |
| **Scope creep** | Asks for features outside pack during sales | Acknowledge, document, do NOT commit. Offer as future roadmap |
| **No-show pattern** | 2+ reschedules or no-shows | Downgrade priority. Written follow-up. 3rd no-show → disqualify |

### C3.5 Forecast Categories

| Category | Definition | How to Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Commit** | Verbal yes. In negotiation/procurement. >80% confidence | 90% of value |
| **Best Case** | Demo done. Champion active. Decision this quarter. >50% | 50% of value |
| **Upside** | Qualified. In discovery/demo. Possible this quarter | 20% of value |

**Weighted Forecast = (Commit x 0.9) + (Best Case x 0.5) + (Upside x 0.2)**

## C4. THERAPEUTIC PACK MONETIZATION PLAYBOOK

### C4.1 How Packs Accelerate Revenue (show this to the team)

| Without Pack | With Pack | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Generic demo → buyer must imagine their use case | Their therapeutic area, their endpoints, their drug class | **-3 weeks** discovery-to-conviction |
| "Does it work for oncology?" → need proof-of-concept | Validated cases with expert sign-off → proof exists | **-4 weeks** PoC phase eliminated |
| "What exactly are we buying?" → scope negotiation | Pack has defined scope + deliverables + success criteria | **-2 weeks** proposal-to-signature |
| Platform = commodity pricing ($50k-$75k) | "Platform + Lung Cancer Pack" = specialized ($100k-$125k) | **+$25k-$50k ACV** |
| No upsell path | "Add Immunology Pack" = $25k-$40k | **Built-in expansion** |

**Net effect:** 40-60% shorter sales cycle. +10-15pp win rate. +$25-50k ACV. Built-in expansion.

### C4.2 Default Offer Positioning — Always Use This

**Rule:** Never sell naked platform. Every proposal = Platform + at least 1 Pack.

**Positioning script (memorize this):**
> "ArcaScience isn't a generic analytics tool. We deliver ready-to-use benefit-risk assessment for your specific therapeutic area. When you buy BRA for Lung Cancer, you get pre-configured endpoints, validated risk templates, a golden-path demo case your team can follow, and BRAT/CIOMS-ready exports — all on day one. The platform is the engine. The therapeutic pack is what makes it drive."

**Proposal structure:**
1. Lead with the therapeutic pack story (problem → BRA output → regulatory value)
2. Show the golden-path demo case
3. Present pricing as "Platform + [Area] Pack"
4. Offer second pack as expansion (plant the seed)
5. Never show platform-only pricing. It doesn't exist as an offer

### C4.3 Anti-Custom-Work Playbook

| Customer Request | Response |
|---|---|
| "Add a custom endpoint for our molecule" | "Our pack covers [X] standard endpoints. Custom endpoints are Professional Services at $2,500/day, min 5 days. If broadly relevant, we may add to roadmap — no timeline commitment." |
| "BRA for a rare disease you don't cover" | "Not on roadmap yet. We can discuss a Design Partner arrangement: 50% co-funded pack development, early access." |
| "Build an integration with our system" | "Enterprise tier includes integration support. Scoped and estimated in contract. Tier 1-2 are standard only." |
| "Bespoke report format" | "BRAT + CIOMS formats included. Bespoke = add-on Professional Services. We recommend standard formats — regulators already accept them." |

**The rule:** Every hour of custom work = 1x value. Every hour of pack work = Nx value. Protect the N.

---

## C5. CUSTOMER EXPANSION PLAYBOOK

### C5.1 Expansion Triggers — When to Initiate Conversation

| Signal | Threshold | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active users exceed tier | >5 (Tier 1) or >15 (Tier 2) | Need more seats → upgrade | Propose tier upgrade |
| BRA workflows >10/month | Consistent high usage | Tool is embedded → add area | Propose new pack |
| Exploring non-purchased area | Any query outside current pack | Organic interest in expansion | Initiate conversation within 1 week |
| Power users >3 | 3+ people at 3+/sessions/week | Account is sticky → lock in | Propose multi-year + new pack |
| Export downloads >5/month | Active regulatory use | Critical workflow tool | Multi-year lock-in conversation |
| Support ticket re: uncovered area | Any | Explicit expansion signal | Propose new pack within 48 hours |

### C5.2 Expansion Motion (Step-by-Step)

1. **Detect trigger** → usage dashboard flags it (or you notice manually)
2. **Schedule "Value Review"** → call with champion within 1 week. Agenda: their usage data, their wins, other therapeutic areas in their pipeline
3. **Present options** → additional pack ($25-40k), tier upgrade, multi-year discount
4. **Send proposal** → within 48 hours of interest. 1-page amendment to existing contract
5. **Close** → target 2 weeks (no new procurement cycle — amendment, not new contract)

### C5.3 Timeline

| Month After Signing | Activity |
|---|---|
| Month 1 | Activate all users. Ensure 1+ workflow per user completed |
| Month 2 | ID power users. First Value Review call |
| Month 3 | Expansion proposal if health score >70 |

**This quarter:** Customer signed Wk 1-4 = expansion candidate Wk 8-12.

---

## C6. FOUNDER REVENUE PLAYBOOK

### C6.1 CEO Time Allocation

**Minimum 30% of CEO time on revenue activities. Non-negotiable.**

| Activity | Frequency | Hours/Week |
|---|---|---|
| Outbound (email, LinkedIn, warm intros) | Daily | 5 |
| Discovery + demo calls | 3-5x/week | 3-5 |
| Pipeline review (internal) | 2x/week | 1 |
| Proposal writing | As needed | 2 |
| Warm intro requests to investors/advisors | 2x/week | 0.5 |
| Reference customer calls | As needed | 1 |
| **Total minimum** | | **12-15 hrs/week** |

**Calendar rule:** Revenue activities go on the calendar first. Everything else fills gaps.

### C6.2 Enterprise Deal Playbook (>$150k ACV)

| Phase | CEO Does | Support From |
|---|---|---|
| **Prospecting** | Sends first email / makes warm intro. Enterprise buyers respond to founders | — |
| **Discovery** | Runs the call. Understands their BRA pain, regulatory pressure, internal politics | Vassili on standby for clinical questions |
| **Demo** | Sets strategic context ("why BRA matters now"). Hands to Vassili for clinical demo | Charbel ensures demo env is stable |
| **Proposal** | Presents pricing as "partnership," not vendor sale | — |
| **Negotiation** | Handles objections. Offers multi-year or expanded scope. NOT discounts | Jeff if security/compliance questions |
| **Exec Alignment** | CEO-to-VP call with economic buyer. Builds relationship beyond the deal | — |
| **Close** | Calls champion day before decision. Reinforces urgency | — |

### C6.3 Warm Intro Mining Plan

| Source | What to Ask | When | Target Intros |
|---|---|---|---|
| Investors | "Intro to 2 portfolio pharma companies" | Week 1, follow up monthly | 2 per investor |
| Advisors/Board | "3 intros to pharma contacts this quarter" | Week 1, follow up Week 5 | 3 per advisor |
| Existing customers | "1 intro to a peer company" | After every milestone win | 1 per customer |
| Conference contacts | Follow up within 48h with BRA value prop | Per event | 3-5 per event |
| Vassili's KOL network | Clinical intros to pharma contacts | Ongoing | 2-3 per month |

**Every intro request → logged in CRM. Follow up within 72 hours.**

### C6.4 Reference Story Deployment

**Use these stories in:**
- Discovery calls: "Can I share how [Company X] used BRA to cut assessment time from 3 months to 2 days?"
- Proposals: 1-page case study as appendix (problem → BRA output → time saved)
- Procurement: "Who else uses this?" → named references close deals
- Expansion: "Your oncology team saw [X result]. Your immunology team has the same pain."

**Story must include:** Quantified time savings + regulatory acceptance + named therapeutic area + customer approval for external use.

# APPENDIX

## A. KEY DEFINITIONS

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **ARR Run-Rate** | Annualized value of all active subscriptions at quarter end. $125k contract in Week 10 = $125k ARR (not prorated) |
| **Qualified Opportunity** | Deal at S2+ with confirmed pain, champion, process, and budget discussion |
| **Power User** | 3+ sessions/week, completes full BRA workflows |
| **Therapeutic Pack** | Pre-configured BRA module: endpoints, risk templates, queries, golden-path demo case |
| **Definition of Done (Pack)** | Pack + Demo Case + Medical Validation + GTM Bundle — all four |
| **Pipeline Coverage** | Qualified pipeline $ / remaining ARR target. Minimum 3x |
| **BRAT** | Benefit-Risk Action Team framework (regulatory standard) |
| **CIOMS** | Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences |

## B. STRUCTURAL UPGRADE RECOMMENDATIONS

### B.1 Add "Revenue Readiness" Gate to O2
Add a 5th DoD requirement: **"First qualified opportunity generated using this pack."** A pack isn't launched until it has produced a sales conversation.

### B.2 Split O3 into Two Sub-Objectives
- **O3a: New Business ($350k)** — hunting. CEO-driven. Prospecting, demos, closes
- **O3b: Expansion ($150k)** — farming. Product/CS-driven. Usage data, health scores, upsell

Different owners, different cadences, different skills. Separating them creates clearer accountability.

### B.3 Elevate Pipeline Generation
Pipeline coverage is a KR, but it's actually the leading precondition for all revenue. Consider making "Maintain 3x coverage every week" an operating discipline with its own escalation protocol (this document provides one above).

---

## C. TARGET ACCOUNT PROFILE (TAP)

Use this to qualify whether an account belongs on the target list:

- [ ] Pharma/biotech with 3+ active clinical programs
- [ ] Has pharmacovigilance or benefit-risk function
- [ ] Currently doing BRA manually (Excel, Word, consultants)
- [ ] Budget authority at VP/Director level accessible
- [ ] In a therapeutic area where we have/are building packs
- [ ] Annual R&D budget >$50M (mid-market) or >$500M (enterprise)

**If 5 of 6 boxes checked → add to target list. If <4 → pass.**

---

*This document is a living operating system.*
*Update Part B scorecards weekly.*
*Review Part C checklists in your rituals.*
*Present Part A to the team at kickoff and to the board at quarter-end.*

*If execution discipline is respected, $500k ARR is not aspirational — it is arithmetically inevitable.*
