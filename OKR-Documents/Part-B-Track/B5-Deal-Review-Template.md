### Usage Instructions

Use this template during every Tuesday Pipeline Review for each active deal. Fill one per deal. Walk through each field in order during the review meeting. The DECISION line is the outcome of the review -- every deal must exit the review with a clear decision: Advance, Hold, Escalate, or Disqualify.
