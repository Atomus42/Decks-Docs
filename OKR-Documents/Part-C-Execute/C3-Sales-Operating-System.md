## C3.2 Qualification Criteria (MEDDPIC for BRA)

**A deal is "qualified" (S2+) only when ALL confirmed:**

| Letter | Criteria | Must-Have Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **M** | Metrics — cost of current BRA process | Can quantify: "$X per assessment" or "Y months per report" |
| **E** | Economic Buyer — who signs | Named individual, VP+ level |
| **D** | Decision Criteria — what they evaluate | Speed, auditability, compliance (at least 2 of 3) |
| **D** | Decision Process — procurement steps | Steps + timeline documented |
| **P** | Pain — what's broken | Specific: failed audit / behind schedule / lost submission |
| **I** | Identify Champion — internal advocate | Named person who will fight for us |
| **C** | Competition — who else they evaluate | Known: no one, consultants, or named competitor |

## C3.3 Disqualification Triggers — Kill the Deal If:

1. No budget confirmed AND no budget cycle within 60 days
2. No identifiable pain — they're "exploring" without urgency
3. Decision maker 3+ levels removed from contact
4. Therapeutic area outside our launched disease-specific versions (unless >$200k enterprise)
5. Want free pilot with no defined success criteria
6. Procurement timeline >90 days
7. Want custom work that doesn't map to a therapeutic axis
8. Gone silent >14 days despite 3 follow-up attempts

## C3.4 Red Flag Playbook

| Red Flag | How to Detect | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Ghost champion** | No response in 7 days | Multi-thread: contact a 2nd person. If no response in 14 days → disqualify |
| **Happy ears** | "Sounds great!" but no next step scheduled | Force it: "Can we schedule the next step right now?" |
| **Infinite pilot** | Pilot >30 days, no evaluation criteria met | Set 48-hour deadline for evaluation call. Kill if no engagement |
| **Procurement black hole** | In legal with no named contact or timeline | Get named procurement contact + expected date. No name = not real |
| **Scope creep** | Asks for features outside therapeutic axis during sales | Acknowledge, document, do NOT commit. Offer as future roadmap |
| **No-show pattern** | 2+ reschedules or no-shows | Downgrade priority. Written follow-up. 3rd no-show → disqualify |

## C3.5 Forecast Categories

| Category | Definition | How to Count |
|---|---|---|
| **Commit** | Verbal yes. In negotiation/procurement. >80% confidence | 90% of value |
| **Best Case** | Demo done. Champion active. Decision this quarter. >50% | 50% of value |
| **Upside** | Qualified. In discovery/demo. Possible this quarter | 20% of value |

**Weighted Forecast = (Commit x 0.9) + (Best Case x 0.5) + (Upside x 0.2)**
