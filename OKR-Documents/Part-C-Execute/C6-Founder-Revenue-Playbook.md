# C6 — Founder Revenue Playbook

## C6.1 CEO Time Allocation

**Minimum 30% of CEO time on revenue activities. Non-negotiable.**

| Activity | Frequency | Hours/Week |
|---|---|---|
| Outbound (email, LinkedIn, warm intros) | Daily | 5 |
| Discovery + demo calls | 3-5x/week | 3-5 |
| Pipeline review (internal) | 2x/week | 1 |
| Proposal writing | As needed | 2 |
| Warm intro requests to investors/advisors | 2x/week | 0.5 |
| Reference customer calls | As needed | 1 |
| **Total minimum** | | **12-15 hrs/week** |

**Calendar rule:** Revenue activities go on the calendar first. Everything else fills gaps.

## C6.2 Enterprise Deal Playbook (>$150k ACV)

| Phase | CEO Does | Support From |
|---|---|---|
| **Prospecting** | Sends first email / makes warm intro. Enterprise buyers respond to founders | — |
| **Discovery** | Runs the call. Understands their BRA pain, regulatory pressure, internal politics | Vassili on standby for clinical questions |
| **Demo** | Sets strategic context ("why BRA matters now"). Hands to Vassili for clinical demo | Charbel ensures demo env is stable |
| **Proposal** | Presents pricing as "partnership," not vendor sale | — |
| **Negotiation** | Handles objections. Offers multi-year or expanded scope. NOT discounts | Jeff if security/compliance questions |
| **Exec Alignment** | CEO-to-VP call with economic buyer. Builds relationship beyond the deal | — |
| **Close** | Calls champion day before decision. Reinforces urgency | — |

## C6.3 Warm Intro Mining Plan

| Source | What to Ask | When | Target Intros |
|---|---|---|---|
| Investors | "Intro to 2 portfolio pharma companies" | Week 1, follow up monthly | 2 per investor |
| Advisors/Board | "3 intros to pharma contacts this quarter" | Week 1, follow up Week 5 | 3 per advisor |
| Existing customers | "1 intro to a peer company" | After every milestone win | 1 per customer |

| Vassili's KOL network | Clinical intros to pharma contacts | Ongoing | 2-3 per month |

**Every intro request → logged in CRM. Follow up within 72 hours.**

## C6.4 Reference Story Deployment

**Use these stories in:**
- Discovery calls: "Can I share how [Company X] used BRA to cut assessment time from 3 months to 2 days?"
- Proposals: 1-page case study as appendix (problem → BRA output → time saved)
- Procurement: "Who else uses this?" → named references close deals
- Expansion: "Your oncology team saw [X result]. Your immunology team has the same pain."

**Story must include:** Quantified time savings + regulatory acceptance + named therapeutic area + customer approval for external use.
