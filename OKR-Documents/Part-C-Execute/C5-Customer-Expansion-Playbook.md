# C5 — Customer Expansion Playbook

## C5.1 Expansion Triggers — When to Initiate Conversation

| Signal | Threshold | What It Means | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active users exceed tier | >5 (Tier 1) or >15 (Tier 2) | Need more seats → upgrade | Propose tier upgrade |
| BRA workflows >10/month | Consistent high usage | Tool is embedded → add area | Propose new therapeutic axis |
| Exploring non-purchased area | Any query outside current axis | Organic interest in expansion | Initiate conversation within 1 week |
| Power users >3 | 3+ people at 3+/sessions/week | Account is sticky → lock in | Propose multi-year + new axis |
| Export downloads >5/month | Active regulatory use | Critical workflow tool | Multi-year lock-in conversation |
| Support ticket re: uncovered area | Any | Explicit expansion signal | Propose new therapeutic axis within 48 hours |

## C5.2 Expansion Motion (Step-by-Step)

1. **Detect trigger** → usage dashboard flags it (or you notice manually)
2. **Schedule "Value Review"** → call with champion within 1 week. Agenda: their usage data, their wins, other therapeutic areas in their pipeline
3. **Present options** → additional therapeutic axis ($25-40k), tier upgrade, multi-year discount
4. **Send proposal** → within 48 hours of interest. 1-page amendment to existing contract
5. **Close** → target 2 weeks (no new procurement cycle — amendment, not new contract)

## C5.3 Timeline

| Month After Signing | Activity |
|---|---|
| Month 1 | Activate all users. Ensure 1+ workflow per user completed |
| Month 2 | ID power users. First Value Review call |
| Month 3 | Expansion proposal if health score >70 |

**This quarter:** Customer signed Wk 1-4 = expansion candidate Wk 8-12.
