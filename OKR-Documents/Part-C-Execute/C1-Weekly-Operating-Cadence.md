# C1 — Weekly Operating Cadence: The Non-Negotiable Rhythm

| Day | Ritual | Duration | Who | What Happens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Every day** | BRA OKR Scoreboard | 30 min | All | Review: time-to-output, insights, acceptance, bugs, uptime. Blockers? |
| **Tuesday** | Pipeline Review | 30 min | CEO + team | Every deal reviewed (B5 template). Coverage check. Next actions assigned |
| **Wednesday** | Therapeutic Axis Standup | 30 min | Vassili + Charbel + Jeff + Data-Team | Dataset structuring progress. Validation status. Blockers. KOL scheduling |
| **Thursday** | "Fixing" Session | 60 min | Vassili + Charbel | Credibility, noise, calibration — maintains quality while moving fast |
| **Friday** | Sales Forecast + Week-Ahead | 15 min | CEO | Forecast update (B2). Kill list. Next week's meetings prepped |

**Rule:** These meetings happen every week. No exceptions. No rescheduling. They are the heartbeat of the quarter.
