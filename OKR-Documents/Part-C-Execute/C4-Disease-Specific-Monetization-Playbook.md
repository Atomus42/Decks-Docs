# C4 — Disease-Specific Version Monetization Playbook

## C4.1 How Disease-Specific Versions Accelerate Revenue

| Without Disease-Specific Version | With Disease-Specific Version | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Generic demo → buyer must imagine their use case | Their therapeutic area, their endpoints, their drug class — validated data | **-3 weeks** discovery-to-conviction |
| "Does it work for oncology?" → need proof-of-concept | Validated datasets with KOL sign-off → proof exists | **-4 weeks** PoC phase eliminated |
| "What exactly are we buying?" → scope negotiation | Defined scope: structured datasets + functional demo + success criteria | **-2 weeks** proposal-to-signature |
| Platform = commodity pricing ($50k-$75k) | "Platform + Lung Cancer version" = specialized ($100k-$125k) | **+$25k-$50k ACV** |
| No upsell path | "Add Immunology version" = $50k-$100k | **Built-in expansion** |

**Net effect:** 40-60% shorter sales cycle. +10-15pp win rate. +$25-50k ACV. Built-in expansion.

## C4.2 Default Offer Positioning — Always Use This

**Rule:** Never sell naked platform. Every proposal = Platform + at least 1 disease-specific version.

**Positioning script (memorize this):**

> "ArcaScience isn't a generic analytics tool. We deliver ready-to-use benefit-risk assessment for your specific therapeutic area. When you buy BRA for Lung Cancer, you get structured datasets (Landscape, Disease, Benefit, Risk), validated by KOLs and internal benchmarks, a functional demo your team can follow, and a complete BRA pipeline (Context, Assessment, Analysis) — all on day one. The platform is the engine. The disease-specific version is what makes it drive."

**Proposal structure:**

1. Lead with the therapeutic area story (problem → BRA output → regulatory value)
2. Show the functional demo for their disease area
3. Present pricing as "Platform + [Area] Version"
4. Offer second therapeutic axis as expansion (plant the seed)
5. Never show platform-only pricing. It doesn't exist as an offer

## C4.3 Anti-Custom-Work Playbook

| Customer Request | Response |
|---|---|
| "Add a custom endpoint for our molecule" | "Our disease-specific version covers [X] standard endpoints. Custom endpoints are Professional Services at $2,500/day, min 5 days. If broadly relevant, we may add to roadmap — no timeline commitment." |
| "BRA for a rare disease you don't cover" | "Not on roadmap yet. We can discuss a Design Partner arrangement: 50% co-funded dataset development, early access." |
| "Build an integration with our system" | "Enterprise tier includes integration support. Scoped and estimated in contract. Tier 1-2 are standard only." |
| "Bespoke report format" | "BRAT + CIOMS formats included. Bespoke = add-on Professional Services. We recommend standard formats — regulators already accept them." |

**The rule:** Every hour of custom work = 1x value. Every hour of disease-specific dataset work = Nx value. Protect the N.
