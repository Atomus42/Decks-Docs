# Appendix B — Structural Upgrade Recommendations

## B.1 Add "Revenue Readiness" Gate to O2
Add a 7th criterion to the O2 Definition of Done: **"First qualified opportunity generated using this disease-specific version."** A therapeutic axis isn't launched until it has produced a sales conversation.

## B.2 Split O3 into Two Sub-Objectives
- **O3a: New Business ($350k)** — hunting. CEO-driven. Prospecting, demos, closes
- **O3b: Expansion ($150k)** — farming. Product/CS-driven. Usage data, health scores, upsell

Different owners, different cadences, different skills. Separating them creates clearer accountability.

## B.3 Elevate Pipeline Generation
Pipeline coverage is a KR, but it's actually the leading precondition for all revenue. Consider making "Maintain 3x coverage every week" an operating discipline with its own escalation protocol (this document provides one above).
