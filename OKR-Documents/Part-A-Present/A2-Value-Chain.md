# A2 — The Value Chain: How the Three Objectives Connect

```
O1 (Platform)  ──►  O2 (Therapeutic Packs)  ──►  O3 (Revenue)
   ENGINE              ACCELERATOR                OUTCOME
```

| Link | Mechanism | What Breaks if It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| **O1 → O2** | Platform BRA pipeline (Context, B&R Assessment, Data Analysis) enables disease-specific dataset integration | Disease-specific versions can't be built — no data foundation |
| **O2 → O3** | Disease-specific platform versions compress sales cycles by 40-60% | We're selling a generic platform — longer cycles, lower win rate, lower ACV |
| **O3 → O1** | Revenue funds next engineering round | Platform roadmap stalls. No on-prem. No enterprise scale |
| **O1 → O3** | Real client usage (10-50 users) creates internal champions | Expansion revenue = $0 without adoption |

**Critical path:** BRA Step 1 "Context" must reach >= 90% completeness by **Week 4**. First therapeutic axis dataset must be structured by **Week 7**. These are hard dependencies for O3.
