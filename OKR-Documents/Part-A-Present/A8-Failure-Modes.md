# A8 — Failure Modes: The Five Ways We Lose

| # | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"Great product, no revenue"** | O1 and O2 succeed, O3 misses. Board loses GTM confidence. Next round doesn't happen |
| 2 | **"Custom project trap"** | Deals devolve into bespoke consulting. Looks like $500k but it's services, not ARR. Margins crater |
| 3 | **"Pipeline desert"** | So focused on closing that nobody builds new pipe. Quarter ends with $300k and an empty funnel |
| 4 | **"Founder bottleneck"** | Every deal needs CEO from call 1 to close. No system. No scale. CEO burns out |
| 5 | **"Expansion amnesia"** | Existing customers ignored. No APM data. Easiest ARR left on the table |
