# A3 — The Three Objectives at a Glance

---

## O1 — Make the BRA Platform the Reference Way to Do Benefit-Risk

> *Deliver the V1 of the BRA-Platform validated by real client usage, with a fully operational BRA pipeline (Context, Benefit & Risk Assessment, Data Analysis), production-grade reliability, and complete observability.*

**Owners:** Charbel (Product Lead — Workflow & UX) | Jeff (CTO/Eng Lead — Reliability & Infra) | Vassili (Clinical Lead — Benefit-Risk & Validation)

**Weekly Ritual:**
- **Every day — 30 min:** "BRA OKR Scoreboard" review: time-to-output, insights, acceptance, bugs, uptime
- **Every Thursday — 60 min:** "Fixing" session: credibility, noise, calibration — maintains quality while moving fast

### Key Results

| KR | Metric | Target | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| KR 1.1 | Main epics deployed and usable in Production | 5 | App-Team |
| KR 1.1 | Users from companies using the platform | 10-50 users from 1-5 companies | App-Team, Sales-Team |
| KR 1.2 | "Context" — Alt. T. options completeness (validated on 10 studies) | >= 90% | Data-Team |
| KR 1.2 | "Context" — Human work per therapeutic option | < 4h | Data-Team |
| KR 1.3 | "B&R Assessment" — F1 on Risk/Safety endpoints | >= 85% | Data-Team |
| KR 1.3 | "B&R Assessment" — F1 on Efficacy endpoints | >= 85% | Data-Team |
| KR 1.4 | "Data Analysis" — V0 implemented | Delivered | Data-Team |
| KR 1.5 | Code tested (Webapp + API) | 80% | App-Team, Data-Team |
| KR 1.5 | Platform availability | 99% | Devops-Team |
| KR 1.5 | APM data available | 100% | Devops-Team |

## O2 — Creation of a Disease-Specific Platform Version

> *Structure, validate, and integrate disease-specific datasets for 2 therapeutic axes/diseases into the BRA platform, with functional demos ready for each axis.*

**Owner:** Vassili (Clinical Lead / Medical Strategy — Benefit-Risk & Validation)

### Key Results

| KR | Metric | Target | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| KR 2.1 | Relevant Datasets generated for therapeutic axes/diseases | 2 | Data-Team |
| KR 2.2 | Outputs validated — external (based on defined criteria) | 4 | Data-Team |
| KR 2.2 | Outputs validated — internal (based on defined criteria) | 4 | Data-Team |
| KR 2.2 | Outputs validated — LLM (based on defined criteria) | 4 | Data-Team |
| KR 2.3 | Added data fully accessible and displayed on platform | 100% | Data-Team |
| KR 2.3 | Functional Demo ready for each therapeutic axis | 2 | Data-Team |

**Main Tasks (KR 2.1):**
1. Benchmark 10 different therapeutic axes/diseases for business potential and platform fit
2. Select 2-3 (2 main, 1 optional/stretch) therapeutic axes/diseases
3. Identify gaps in Quality and use case
4. Listing of all needed improvements: disease-specific or generic
5. Assess feasibility and define action plan
6. Execute the plan
7. Quality control and further improvements

## O3 — Reach $500k Income (60% ARR/40% non-ARR) Run-Rate

> *Build a repeatable revenue engine through disease-specific-first enterprise subscriptions, disciplined pipeline management, and systematic expansion — proving ArcaScience is a scalable commercial entity.*

**Owner:** CEO, supported by all

### Key Results

| KR | Target | Stretch | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARR run-rate | $500k | $650k | CEO |
| New logos signed | 5 | 7 | CEO |
| Accounts expanded | 1 | 4 | CEO + Product |
