## Five Pricing Rules

1. **Never sell platform without a disease-specific version** — "Platform + Therapeutic Axis" is the minimum unit
2. **Never do custom work for <$50k** — price consulting at $2,500/day
3. **Annual contracts only** — no monthly, no quarterly
4. **Multi-year discount:** 10% (2yr), 15% (3yr) — only to accelerate close
5. **Pilots:** 3 months at 40% of annual, with defined success criteria upfront
