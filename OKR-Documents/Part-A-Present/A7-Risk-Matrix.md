# A7 — Risk Matrix: What Could Kill the Quarter

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insufficient pipeline Weeks 1-6 | High | Fatal | CEO: 30%+ time on revenue. Pipeline <2x = emergency mode |
| Sales cycles >60 days | High | Severe | Disease-specific demos. Champion acceleration. Kill >90 day deals |
| Custom work trap | Medium | Severe | "Disease-specific version first." Executive triage for any custom request |
| BRA pipeline F1 scores too low | Medium | High | Weekly "Fixing" sessions. Calibration sprints. Data-Team focus |
| Demo not compelling | Medium | High | Demo-ability gate at Week 2. Ship 80% quality over 100% late |
| Dataset structuring delays | Medium | High | Parallelize axes. Reduce scope to 2 axes. Cut stretch axis early |
| Expansion = $0 | Medium | Moderate | APM instrumentation by Week 4. Account health reviews monthly |
| ACV erosion (<$80k avg) | Medium | Moderate | Pricing discipline. No discounts — offer multi-year or scope instead |
| Deals slip to next quarter | High | Moderate | Focus warm pipeline. Compress procurement. Mid-market backup plan |

## Cut List (in order of priority if spread too thin)

1. Cut Axis 3 (stretch) — optional, not core
2. Cut KR1.5d stretch (10 min ship time — accept 15 min)
3. Cut conference attendance (unless 3+ qualified prospects there)
4. Cut internal process improvements mid-quarter
5. **NEVER cut:** Pipeline reviews, demo prep, proposal speed, Thursday "Fixing" sessions
