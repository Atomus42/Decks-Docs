# A1 — Why This Quarter Is Different

> Use this section for team kickoff, investor updates, and board presentations.

This is a **leverage quarter**. We have a working platform, differentiated tech, and early traction. Now we prove three things:

| Proof Point | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Production-ready BRA platform** | V1 deployed with 5 epics, real client usage (10-50 users), full BRA pipeline (Context, B&R Assessment, Data Analysis), 99% uptime |
| **Disease-specific platform versions** | 2 therapeutic axes with structured, validated datasets integrated in the platform + functional demos |
| **Repeatable revenue engine** | We can sell $500k ARR through a disciplined, disease-specific motion |

If we prove all three, we become the global standard. If we prove two out of three, we have a strong company. If we prove one, we're a science project.

**Quarter Narrative:** *"Deliver the V1 BRA platform with real client usage, create disease-specific versions for 2 therapeutic axes, and validate traction with $500k ARR."*

**Team:** Charbel (Product Lead — Workflow & UX) | Jeff (CTO/Eng Lead — Reliability & Infra) | Vassili (Clinical Lead / Medical Strategy — Benefit-Risk & Validation) | CEO (Revenue + Strategy)
