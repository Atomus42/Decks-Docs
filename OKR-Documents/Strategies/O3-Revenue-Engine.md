## Structural Upgrade Recommendations

### B.2 Split O3 into Two Sub-Objectives

- **O3a: New Business ($350k)** — hunting. CEO-driven. Prospecting, demos, closes.
- **O3b: Expansion ($150k)** — farming. Product/CS-driven. Usage data, health scores, upsell.

Different owners, different cadences, different skills. Separating them creates clearer accountability.

### B.3 Elevate Pipeline Generation

Pipeline coverage is a KR, but it is actually the leading precondition for all revenue. Consider making "Maintain 3x coverage every week" an operating discipline with its own escalation protocol (this document provides one above).
