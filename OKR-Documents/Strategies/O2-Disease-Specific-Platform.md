# O2 — Creation of a Disease-Specific Platform Version

**Owner:** Vassili (Clinical Lead / Medical Strategy — Benefit-Risk & Validation)

**Objective:**
> *Structure, validate, and integrate disease-specific datasets for 2 therapeutic axes/diseases into the BRA platform, with functional demos ready for each axis.*

**Weekly Ritual:**
- **Every Wednesday — 30 min:** "Therapeutic Axis Standup": Dataset structuring progress. Validation status. Blockers. KOL scheduling (Vassili + Charbel + Jeff + Data-Team)

## KR 2.1 — Structuring of all relevant Data (Landscape, Disease, Benefit, Risk) for 2 therapeutic axes/Diseases

| Metric | Current | Target | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generation of relevant Datasets for 2 Therapeutic axis/diseases | 0 | 2 | Data-Team |

### Main Tasks

1. Benchmark 10 different Therapeutic axes/diseases for their: business potential, platform fit
2. Select 2-3 (2 main, 1 optional/stretch) Therapeutic axes/diseases to be executed within current capabilities
3. Identify the gaps to be addressed in terms of: Quality and use case (address to R&D and Clinical development teams) — specify to which output it belongs
4. Listing of all needed improvements: are they disease-specific or could be addressed in a generic approach?
5. Assess the feasibility and define an action plan to address each of these gaps
6. Execute the plan
7. Quality control and further improvements

*Needed Resources: TO BE DEFINED*
*Dependencies and Interactions with Other KRs: TO BE DEFINED*

## KR 2.2 — Internal and external Validation of the generated Datasets

| Metric | Current | Target | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Outputs validated using external validation based on defined criteria | 0 | 4 | Data-Team |
| Outputs validated using internal validation based on defined criteria | 0 | 4 | Data-Team |
| Outputs validated using LLM validation based on defined criteria | 0 | 4 | Data-Team |

### Main Tasks — External Validation

- Identification and contact of 5 relevant KOLs
- Questionnaire/interview guide developed for each platform output
- Deliver analysis of results as % data validated
- Integrate 100% of the feedback to improve the dataset

### Main Tasks — Internal Validation

- Generation of the test Datasets
- Creation of the Test Datasets
- Creation of the test requirements
- Annotation of the test data
- Deliver analysis of results as % data validated
- Integrate 100% of the feedback to improve the dataset

### Main Tasks — Validation by an LLM

- Creation of the test prompt
- Validation of the test prompt
- Test execution
- Deliver analysis of results as % data validated
- Integrate 100% of the feedback to improve the dataset

*Needed Resources: TO BE DEFINED*
*Dependencies and Interactions with Other KRs: TO BE DEFINED*

## KR 2.3 — Integration of the Final Datasets inside the Platform BRA

| Metric | Current | Target | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| % of added data fully accessible and displayed on the platform | 0 | 100% | Data-Team |
| Functional Demo ready for each therapeutic axis | 0 | 2 | Data-Team |

### Main Tasks

1. Anticipation of the display for the therapeutic verticals: Sales, Marketing, Product dependency
2. Align to the product roadmap
3. Selection of adapted features (specific / generic)
4. Modification of the UX
5. Test the UX
6. Creation of the Demo Storytelling

| Axis | Dataset Structured (KR2.1)? | External Validation (KR2.2)? | Internal Validation (KR2.2)? | LLM Validation (KR2.2)? | Integrated in Platform (KR2.3)? | Demo Ready (KR2.3)? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Axis 1 — TBD | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | __ % done |
| Axis 2 — TBD | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | __ % done |
| Axis 3 (stretch) — TBD | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | __ % done |

## O2 Definition of Done (per Axis)

A therapeutic axis is **done** when all six criteria are satisfied:

| # | Criterion | KR |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Dataset Structured** | KR2.1 |
| 2 | **External Validation** | KR2.2 |
| 3 | **Internal Validation** | KR2.2 |
| 4 | **LLM Validation** | KR2.2 |
| 5 | **Integrated in Platform** | KR2.3 |
| 6 | **Demo Ready** | KR2.3 |
